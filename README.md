# Better_Weather

This program is written in Python. Its purpose is to collect weather forecast data from a few websites (e.g. Open-Meteo, WeatherAPI) and combine it into one more accurate weather prediction. After providing the location eg. "Madrid" you will receive a file with weather data and a user-friendly plot. The file will contain raw forecast data acquired from web pages and counted mean values. The plot file will contain hourly temperature and precipitation graph.
